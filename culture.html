            <p>Miami enjoys a vibrant culture that is influenced by a diverse 
                population from all around the world. Miami is known as the 
                "Magic City" for seemingly popping up overnight due to its 
                young age and massive growth. It is also nicknamed the "Capital 
                of Latin America" because of its high population of Spanish-speakers.</p>
        
            <h2>Entertainment</h2>

            <p>The cuisine of Miami is a reflection of its diverse population, with a 
                heavy influence from Caribbean and Latin American cuisine. By combining 
                the two with American cuisine, it has spawned a unique South Florida 
                style of cooking known as Floribbean cuisine. It is widely available 
                throughout Miami and South Florida and can be found in restaurant chains 
                such as Pollo Tropical. Cuban immigrants in the 1960s originated the 
                Cuban sandwich and brought medianoche, Cuban espresso, and croquetas, 
                all of which have grown in popularity among all Miamians and have become 
                symbols of the city's varied cuisine. The city is also 
                the headquarters of restaurant chains such as Burger King and Benihana. 
                While meal prices in Miami can vary, the average cost of food in Miami 
                is $33 per day. Based on the spending habits of previous travelers, when 
                dining out an average meal in Miami should cost around $13 per person. 
                Breakfast prices are usually a little cheaper than lunch or dinner.</p>

                <p class="left">Today, these are part of the local culture and can be found throughout the city 
                at window cafes, particularly outside of supermarkets and restaurants. Some of 
                these locations, such as the Versailles restaurant in Little Havana, are landmark eateries 
                of Miami. Located on the Atlantic Ocean, and with a long history as a seaport, 
                Miami is also known for its seafood, with many seafood restaurants located 
                along the Miami River and in and around Biscayne Bay.</p>
